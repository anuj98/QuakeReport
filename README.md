# QuakeReport
This app gives the information about the earthquakes that took place recently. It shows the magnitude(with color, which shows how 
how dangerous it is), the place where it oringinated and the date. To get the details we have used the USGS json api. On clicking 
any one of the eartquake details it takes you to the USGS site for detailed information about the earthquake. Also there is a 
setting for minimum magnitude which the user can set.
